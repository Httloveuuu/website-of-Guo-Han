                            "Devil May Cry" (English: Devil May Cry, Japanese: デビル メイ クライ, meaning "Devil May Cry"), other Chinese translations: "Demon Hunter", "Demon Trembling", is an action stand-alone game published by CAPCOM in Japan, featuring gorgeous combat performance, both the scene, atmosphere, and system are excellent. The game tells the story of a superhuman demon hunter who runs a business called "Devil May Cry" and fights against demons from the demon world to stop them from invading the world.

                            Players can control the protagonist to use a large sword or firearms, as well as various weapons, to defeat enemies (demons) in order to take risks. Although it is a simple story of exhorting good and punishing evil, the game is simple and gorgeous, with fast action, hardcore difficulty, and the thrill of taking down enemies with tension, and it was created in the "Stylish Action" genre, which was later serialized as one of CAPCOM's signature works.
