                        This chapter offered a number of strategies for
                        avoiding ethical abuses. Think about the
                        following situations and complete the following.

                    <p>1. Read the technical communications Ethics Scenario.</p>
                    <p>
                        2. On the Discussion Board, provide answers to the four questions listed under
                        the Ethics Scenario. Copy and paste each question and then provide
                        feedback to each question.
                    </p>
                    <p>3. Review the response from (1) of your peers and provide feedback to the
                        Peer RESPONSE QUESTIONS.</p>
                    <p>4. Students will not be able to see the post of their peers until after they have
                        posted their own response.</p>

                        <div>You work for a major information technology company. You have been authorized
                            to hire a technical assistant and are about to prepare an
                            advertisement. You are seeking this assistant during a time
                            of threatened cutbacks for your company. People hired as
                            “temporary,” however, have never seemed to work out well.

                        informed that the job may be temporary? Would you apply for the job?
                    </p>
                    <p class="mt-3">3. As an employee of the company, should you include a warning that this
                        position could be only temporary? Why or why not? Consider your decision
                        from the standpoint of the technical assistant whose job it is to write an
                        advertisement that will draw applicants to the position.
